# Elec_Analysis

##Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this election audit is to assist Tom a board of Elections employee in reporting a summary of the election results in the Colorado elections using python. The python script when ran with the election results data provides information on the total number of votes casts, votes attained by each candidate and their respective percentages. The script also calculates the number of votes cast in each county with their percentage of total votes. The python code written to perform these functions automates the audit and can be reused for an infinite number of similar data sets to do the same. The code makes use of for loops, dictionaries, lists and conditional statements in carrying out these processes and providing the election commission with the county with the highest turnout and the winner of the election. The results of this code are contained in a text file labeled election_analysis.txt

##Election-Audit Summary


With some modifications this python script could also be used to collate voting results for election results at all levels and stages and government. This script can be modified to provide us with information on how many votes per county were recorded for each candidate. It could also be adjusted to also include information on which candidate scored the highest on a county-by-county scale.
